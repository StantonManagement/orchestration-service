## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 established the basic FastAPI service structure. Story 1.2 provides the external service integration for retrieving tenant context and conversation history. This story builds on both by implementing the AI response generation that uses that context.

### AI Service Integration Requirements
**OpenAI API Configuration:**
- Purpose: Generate contextual responses for tenant communications using GPT-4-turbo
- Base URL: `https://api.openai.com/v1`
- Authentication: API key (configured via `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- Key endpoint: `POST /chat/completions` - Generate AI responses with gpt-4-turbo model
- Critical for core functionality - SMS processing cannot proceed without AI responses
- Rate limits: 3500 requests/minute for gpt-4-turbo
- Temperature 0.7 for consistency, max_tokens 200 for SMS limits
- Confidence scoring based on response analysis and tenant context match
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md]

### AI Response Generation Service Component
**Key Interfaces:**
- `generate_response(tenant_context, conversation_history, message, language) -> AIResponse`
- `calculate_confidence(response, tenant_context) -> Decimal`
- `extract_payment_plan(message, response) -> Optional[PaymentPlan]`

**Dependencies:** OpenAI API, Collections Monitor (for tenant context), SMS Agent (conversation history)

**Technology Stack:** OpenAI Python SDK, async prompt engineering, confidence scoring algorithms, payment plan pattern matching
[Source: architecture/components.md]

### SMS Processing Workflow Integration
This story implements the AI response generation step in the main SMS processing workflow:
1. Orchestrator receives SMS via `/orchestrate/sms-received`
2. Retrieves tenant context from Collections Monitor (Story 1.2)
3. Gets conversation history from SMS Agent (Story 1.2)
4. **AI Response Generation (this story)**
5. Confidence-based routing (>85% auto-send, 60-84% approval, <60% escalation)
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]

### Technology Stack
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API with gpt-4-turbo for response generation
- **Language**: Python 3.11+ with type hints
- **HTTP Client**: OpenAI Python SDK (built on httpx)
- **Error Handling**: Custom exceptions with retry logic
- **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs
- **Configuration**: Environment variables through config module
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Data Models
**AIResponse Object Structure:**
- response_text: String - Generated AI response
- confidence_score: Decimal (0.0-1.0) - AI confidence level
- language_preference: String - Tenant's preferred language
- tokens_used: Integer - API token usage for tracking
- response_metadata: JSON - Additional response metadata

**Tenant Context Integration:**
- Payment history and current balance
- Language preference (English, Spanish, etc.)
- Payment arrangement history
- Communication preferences

**Conversation History Integration:**
- Recent messages for context continuity
- Previous AI responses and tenant reactions
- Payment plan discussions
- Escalation history

### Project Structure
Based on the source tree architecture, this story requires creating:
- `app/services/ai_service.py` - AI response generation service
- Update `app/config.py` - Add OPENAI_API_KEY configuration
- `tests/test_services/test_ai_service.py` - Comprehensive AI service tests
- Update `app/core/exceptions.py` - Add AI service specific exceptions
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

### Coding Standards
- Use snake_case for files and functions: `generate_response()`
- Use PascalCase for classes: `AIResponseService`
- Always validate external inputs using Pydantic models
- Use structured logging with correlation IDs (no console.log)
- Never hardcode API keys - use environment variables
- Error responses must follow standard format
- Add comprehensive error handling for external API calls
- Use async/await patterns for API calls
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Testing
**Test Requirements:**
- Framework: pytest 7.4+ with pytest-asyncio
- File location: `tests/test_services/` mirroring `app/services/` structure
- Mock OpenAI API responses using pytest-mock
- Test both successful requests and error conditions
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Target: 80% line coverage for critical paths
**Test scenarios to include:**
- Successful AI response generation with various tenant contexts
- Confidence score calculation accuracy
- SMS formatting and character limit handling
- Language preference support
- API timeout and retry behavior
- Rate limiting awareness
- Error handling for invalid API keys, network failures
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

### Configuration Requirements
Environment variables to add to config.py:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key for GPT-4-turbo access
- `OPENAI_MODEL`: Model name (default: "gpt-4-turbo")
- `OPENAI_TEMPERATURE`: Temperature for response consistency (default: 0.7)
- `OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS`: Maximum tokens for SMS limits (default: 200)
- `OPENAI_TIMEOUT`: API call timeout in seconds (default: 30)

### Confidence Scoring Methodology
Confidence scores should be calculated based on:
- Response relevance to tenant context (40% weight)
- Conversation history continuity (25% weight)
- Language appropriateness (15% weight)
- Business rule compliance (20% weight)
Scores range from 0.0 to 1.0 with >0.85 indicating high confidence

### Response Formatting Requirements
- Standard SMS: 160 characters (GSM-7 encoding)
- Extended SMS: Up to 1600 characters (UCS-2 encoding)
- Respect tenant language preferences
- Include contact information if response is truncated
- Maintain professional and empathetic tone
