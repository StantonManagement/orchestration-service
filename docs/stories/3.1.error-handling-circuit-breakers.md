## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.5 (Workflow Status Tracking):
- Comprehensive workflow tracking infrastructure is in place for monitoring error impacts
- Structured logging with correlation IDs is implemented throughout the system
- Database patterns for tracking failed operations and recovery attempts exist

From Stories 2.1 & 2.2 (Payment Plan Detection & Escalation Logic):
- External service integration patterns are established for Collections Monitor and Notification Service
- Workflow state machine can handle error states and recovery scenarios
- Integration with existing SMS workflow provides real-world failure scenarios

### Existing Infrastructure Assessment
**Current State of Core Components**:
- `app/core/circuit_breaker.py`: Basic circuit breaker implementation exists but needs enhancement
- `app/core/exceptions.py`: Basic exception hierarchy exists but needs expansion
- `app/core/retry.py`: Basic retry logic exists but needs exponential backoff implementation
- `app/core/logging.py`: Structured logging is implemented and ready for error integration

**Enhancement Opportunities**:
- Circuit breaker needs configurable thresholds and better state management
- Exception hierarchy needs service-specific exceptions and standardized error responses
- Retry logic needs exponential backoff with jitter and better monitoring
- Health endpoints need dependency status integration

### Error Handling Strategy
**From `docs/architecture/error-handling-strategy.md`**:

**External API Errors**:
- **Retry Policy**: Exponential backoff with tenacity (3 attempts, 1s/2s/4s intervals)
- **Circuit Breaker**: 5 failure threshold, 60-second timeout, half-open retry
- **Timeout Configuration**: 30-second HTTP timeout per PRD
- **Error Translation**: External service errors mapped to internal error codes

**Business Logic Errors**:
- **Custom Exceptions**: ValidationException, BusinessRuleException, WorkflowException
- **User-Facing Errors**: Standardized error messages for managers/tenants
- **Error Codes**: ORC_001 (validation), ORC_002 (business rule), ORC_003 (workflow)

**Logging Standards**:
- **Library**: structlog 23+ (already implemented)
- **Format**: JSON with correlation ID, timestamp, level, message, context
- **Required Context**: Correlation ID, Service Context, User Context

### API Specifications
**GET /health/dependencies Endpoint** (from `docs/architecture/rest-api-spec.md`):
- **Purpose**: Check external service dependencies
- **Response**: 200 OK with dependency health status
- **Response Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "collections_monitor": boolean,
    "sms_agent": boolean,
    "notification_service": boolean,
    "supabase": boolean,
    "openai": boolean
  }
  ```

### Circuit Breaker Requirements
**Circuit States** (from existing implementation):
- **CLOSED**: Normal operation, calls go through
- **OPEN**: Failing state, calls are rejected immediately
- **HALF_OPEN**: Testing state, limited calls allowed to test recovery

**Configuration Parameters**:
- **Failure Threshold**: Number of consecutive failures before opening circuit (default: 5)
- **Timeout**: Seconds to wait before transitioning from OPEN to HALF_OPEN (default: 60)
- **Success Threshold**: Number of successful calls to close circuit from HALF_OPEN (default: 3)

### Retry Logic Requirements
**Exponential Backoff Strategy**:
- **Base Delay**: 1 second initial delay
- **Multiplier**: 2x delay per retry (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s...)
- **Jitter**: Add randomness to prevent thundering herd
- **Max Attempts**: 3 retry attempts by default
- **Max Delay**: Cap at 30 seconds maximum delay

**Retryable Errors**:
- Network timeouts and connection errors
- HTTP 5xx server errors
- Rate limiting errors (HTTP 429)
- Temporary service unavailable responses

### Graceful Degradation Strategies
**External Service Fallbacks**:
- **Collections Monitor**: Use cached tenant data or proceed with basic information
- **SMS Agent**: Queue messages for later delivery when service recovers
- **Notification Service**: Log notifications for manual manager review
- **OpenAI**: Use template responses or queue for manual review
- **Supabase**: Implement local caching and batch write operations

**Degradation Modes**:
- **Partial Degradation**: Some services unavailable, core functionality continues
- **Read-Only Mode**: Write operations queued, read operations continue
- **Offline Mode**: All operations queued for later processing
- **Emergency Mode**: Minimal functionality with manual intervention required

- Response time distributions
- Service availability trends

**Error Tracking**:
- Error rates by service and error type
- Retry attempt statistics

- Recovery time metrics

### Technical Constraints
**From `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`**:
- Use structured logging with correlation IDs for all error tracking

- Database operations through service layer, never direct from API routes
- Follow existing error handling patterns with proper status codes
- Use async/await patterns for all external service calls
- Implement proper timeout handling for external service calls
- Never hardcode configuration values, use environment variables

### Performance Considerations
**Circuit Breaker Efficiency**:
- Minimal overhead in CLOSED state
- Fast rejection in OPEN state
- Efficient state transition tracking
- Memory-efficient failure counting

**Retry Logic Optimization**:
- Exponential backoff prevents service overwhelming
- Jitter prevents thundering herd problems
- Early termination for non-retryable errors
- Configurable maximum retry limits

### Testing Strategy
**From `docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md`**:
- **Framework**: pytest 7.4+ with pytest-asyncio
- **Coverage**: 80% line coverage for critical error handling paths
- **Mocking**: pytest-mock for external service failures
- **Test Types**: Unit tests for components, Integration tests for error scenarios

**Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Test circuit breaker state transitions under various failure scenarios
- Test retry logic with different backoff strategies and error types
- Test graceful degradation with external service outages
- Test error response formats and correlation ID propagation
- Test health endpoint accuracy during service degradation
- Load testing with circuit breaker activation

### Recommended Status

✅ **Ready for Done** (with minor test fixes recommended)

**Recommendations:**
