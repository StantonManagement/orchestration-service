## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 established the basic FastAPI service structure with health endpoints and SMS reception. The current story builds on this foundation by adding the external service integration needed for complete SMS processing workflow.

### External Service Integration Requirements
**Collections Monitor API (Port 8001):**
- Purpose: Retrieve tenant context information for AI personalization
- Base URL: `http://localhost:8001` (configurable via `MONITOR_URL`)
- Key endpoint: `GET /monitor/tenant/{tenant_id}` - Fetch tenant context, payment history, language preference
- Critical dependency - SMS processing cannot proceed without tenant context
- Circuit breaker with 5 failure threshold and 60-second timeout
- Retry with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts

**SMS Agent API (Port 8002):**
- Purpose: Retrieve conversation history for AI context generation
- Base URL: `http://localhost:8002` (configurable via `SMS_AGENT_URL`)
- Key endpoint: `GET /conversations/{phone_number}` - Retrieve message history for AI context
- Conversation history essential for AI context generation
- Circuit breaker with 3 failure threshold due to high volume
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md]

### Technology Stack
- **HTTP Client**: httpx 0.25+ for async external service calls with native async support
- **Circuit Breaker**: Custom implementation with tenacity 2.0+ for retry logic and exponential backoff
- **Timeout Configuration**: 30-second timeouts for SMS Agent, 60-second for Collections Monitor
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Data Models
No new data models required for this story. Service clients will return raw JSON responses from external services to be processed in subsequent stories.

### Project Structure
Based on the source tree architecture, this story requires creating:
- `app/services/collections_monitor.py` - Collections Monitor service client
- `app/sms_agent.py` - SMS Agent service client
- Update `app/api/health.py` - Add dependency health checks
- Update `app/config.py` - Add external service URL configurations
- `tests/test_services/test_collections_monitor.py` - Tests for Collections Monitor client
- `tests/test_services/test_sms_agent.py` - Tests for SMS Agent client
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

### API Specifications
**GET /health/dependencies endpoint:**
- Returns JSON with connectivity status for each external service
- Response format:
```json
{
  "collections_monitor": true,
  "sms_agent": true,
  "notification_service": false,
  "supabase": false,
  "openai": false
}
```
[Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md#/paths/~1health~1dependencies/get]

### Coding Standards
- Use snake_case for files and functions: `get_tenant_context()`
- Use PascalCase for classes: `CollectionsMonitorClient`
- Always validate external inputs using Pydantic models
- Use structured logging with correlation IDs (no console.log)
- External service calls must go through circuit breaker wrapper
- Error responses must follow standard format
- Never hardcode API keys or service URLs - use environment variables
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Testing
**Test Requirements:**
- Framework: pytest 7.4+ with pytest-asyncio
- File locations: `tests/test_services/` mirroring `app/services/` structure
- Mock external dependencies using pytest-mock
- Test both successful requests and error conditions
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Target: 80% line coverage for critical paths
**Test files to create:**
- `tests/test_services/test_collections_monitor.py` - Test Collections Monitor integration
- `tests/test_services/test_sms_agent.py` - Test SMS Agent integration
- Update `tests/test_api/test_health.py` - Test dependency health checks
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

### Configuration Requirements
Environment variables to add to config.py:
- `MONITOR_URL`: Collections Monitor service URL (default: http://localhost:8001)
- `SMS_AGENT_URL`: SMS Agent service URL (default: http://localhost:8002)
- Timeout configurations for each service
- Circuit breaker thresholds and retry policies
