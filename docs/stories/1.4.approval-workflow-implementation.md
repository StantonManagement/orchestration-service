## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.3 completed AI response generation with confidence scoring. Story 1.4 builds on this by implementing the confidence-based routing logic that automatically sends high-confidence responses (>85%), queues medium-confidence responses (60-84%) for approval, and escalates low-confidence responses (<60%).

### Approval Workflow Component
**Key Interfaces:**
- `route_response_by_confidence(ai_response, workflow_id) -> str` - Returns action: auto_send/queue_for_approval/escalate
- `create_approval_queue_entry(workflow_id, ai_response, confidence_score) -> AIResponseQueue`
- `process_approval_action(queue_id, action, manager_id, modified_text=None) -> bool`
- `send_approved_response(queue_entry) -> bool` - Calls SMS Agent /sms/send
- `notify_managers_for_approval(queue_entry) -> bool` - Calls Notification Service

**Dependencies:** SMS Agent (for sending), Notification Service (for manager alerts), Supabase (for queue storage)

**Technology Stack:** FastAPI router, Pydantic schemas, async database operations, confidence scoring logic
[Source: architecture/components.md]

### Database Schema for Approval Queue
**AIResponseQueue Table Structure:**
- id: UUID - Primary key for queue entry
- workflow_id: UUID - Reference to parent workflow instance
- tenant_message: Text - Original SMS from tenant
- ai_response: Text - Generated AI response requiring approval
- confidence_score: Decimal (0.0-1.0) - AI confidence level
- status: String - Queue status (pending, approved, modified, escalated, auto_sent)
- approval_action: String - Manager action (approve, modify, escalate)
- modified_response: Text - Manager-modified response if applicable
- actioned_by: String - Manager ID who handled the response
- actioned_at: Timestamp - When response was processed
- created_at: Timestamp - Queue entry creation time

**ApprovalAuditLog Table Structure:**
- id: UUID - Primary key for audit entry
- response_queue_id: UUID - Reference to queue item
- action: String - Action taken (approve, modify, escalate)
- original_response: Text - Original AI response
- final_response: Text - Final response sent to tenant
- reason: Text - Reason for modification or escalation
- approved_by: String - Manager ID who approved/modified
- created_at: Timestamp - Audit entry creation time
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]

### Confidence-Based Routing Logic
**Routing Thresholds (from Epic 1):**
- **>85% confidence**: Auto-send response via SMS Agent
- **60-84% confidence**: Queue for manager approval
- **<60% confidence**: Automatic escalation to human review

**Routing Implementation:**
1. Receive AI response with confidence score from Story 1.3
2. Evaluate confidence score against thresholds
3. Auto-send: Call SMS Agent /sms/send, update workflow status to 'sent'
4. Queue approval: Create AIResponseQueue entry, notify managers, update workflow to 'awaiting_approval'
5. Escalate: Create EscalationEvent, notify managers, update workflow to 'escalated'
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]

### SMS Agent Integration
**SMS Sending Endpoint:**
- Purpose: Send approved/modified AI responses to tenants
- Base URL: `http://localhost:8002` (configurable via `SMS_AGENT_URL`)
- Endpoint: `POST /sms/send`
- Expected response: 202 Accepted with message ID
- Critical business function - requires proper error handling and retry logic

**Integration Notes:** Must use existing circuit breaker pattern with 3 failure threshold. Retry with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts. Log all SMS sends with correlation IDs for audit trail.
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md]

### Notification Service Integration
**Manager Notification Endpoint:**
- Purpose: Alert managers when responses require approval or escalations occur
- Base URL: `http://localhost:8003` (configurable via `NOTIFICATION_URL`)
- Endpoint: `POST /notifications/send`
- Includes manager action links and response details
- Important for workflow continuity but not blocking

**Notification Content:**
- Response text requiring approval
- Confidence score and tenant context
- Direct links to approve/modify/escalate actions
- Conversation history for context
- Tenant payment history if relevant
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md]

### Approval API Specification
**POST /orchestrate/approve-response Endpoint:**
- Purpose: Manager approval, modification, or escalation of AI responses
- Request body includes: response_queue_id (UUID), action (approve/modify/escalate), manager_id (string)
- Optional fields: approved_text, modified_text, escalation_reason
- Response: 200 OK with processing confirmation
- Error handling: 404 for missing queue items, 400 for invalid actions

**Request Schema Examples:**
```json
// Approve action
{
  "response_queue_id": "queue-uuid-123",
  "action": "approve",
  "approved_text": "Thank you for your payment arrangement.",
  "manager_id": "manager-001"
}

// Modify action
{
  "response_queue_id": "queue-uuid-123",
  "action": "modify",
  "modified_text": "Thank you. We can arrange $200/week for 8 weeks starting next Friday.",
  "manager_id": "manager-001"
}

// Escalate action
{
  "response_queue_id": "queue-uuid-123",
  "action": "escalate",
  "escalation_reason": "Tenant disputes amount owed",
  "manager_id": "manager-001"
}
```

### Project Structure
Based on the source tree architecture, this story requires creating:
- `app/services/approval_service.py` - Approval workflow logic and confidence routing
- `app/services/notification_service.py` - Manager notification service
- `app/api/approval.py` - Approval endpoint implementation
- `app/models/ai_response.py` - AIResponseQueue and ApprovalAuditLog models
- `app/schemas/approval.py` - Request/response schemas for approval API
- `tests/test_api/test_approval.py` - Approval endpoint tests
- `tests/test_services/test_approval_service.py` - Approval service logic tests

The project structure already has the foundation from Stories 1.1-1.3 with core services, API structure, and database models.
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: FastAPI 0.104+ with async endpoint support
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for approval queue and audit log storage
- **External Services**: SMS Agent (port 8002), Notification Service (port 8003)
- **HTTP Client**: httpx 0.25+ for external service calls with async support
- **Validation**: Pydantic models for request/response validation
- **Error Handling**: Custom exceptions with circuit breaker integration
- **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs for audit trail
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Coding Standards
- Use snake_case for files and functions: `approval_service.py`, `route_response_by_confidence()`
- Use PascalCase for classes: `ApprovalService`, `AIResponseQueue`
- Always validate external inputs using Pydantic models
- Use structured logging with correlation IDs (no console.log)
- Database operations through service layer, never direct from API routes
- External service calls through existing circuit breaker pattern
- All approval actions must create audit trail entries
- Error responses must follow standard ApiResponse format
- Use async/await patterns for all external service calls
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Testing
**Test Requirements:**
- Framework: pytest 7.4+ with pytest-asyncio
- File location: `tests/test_api/` and `tests/test_services/` mirroring app structure

- SMS sending integration success and failure scenarios
- Notification sending for approvals and escalations
- Database operations for queue creation and status updates
- Audit log creation for all approval actions
- Error handling for invalid queue IDs, missing data, service failures
- Integration with existing circuit breaker and retry logic

### Configuration Requirements
Environment variables needed (add to config.py if not present):
- `NOTIFICATION_URL`: Notification Service base URL (default: "http://localhost:8003")
- `APPROVAL_TIMEOUT`: Hours before pending approvals escalate (default: 24)
- `AUTO_APPROVAL_THRESHOLD`: Confidence threshold for auto-send (default: 0.85)
- `ESCALATION_THRESHOLD`: Confidence threshold for escalation (default: 0.60)

### Workflow Integration Notes
This story completes the core SMS processing workflow:
1. ✅ Story 1.1: Service setup and SMS reception
2. ✅ Story 1.2: External service integration (Collections Monitor, SMS Agent)
3. ✅ Story 1.3: AI response generation with confidence scoring
4. 🔄 **Story 1.4: Approval workflow implementation (current)**
5. ⏳ Story 1.5: Workflow status tracking

The approval workflow is critical for business operations, ensuring human oversight of AI-generated responses while maintaining efficient processing for high-confidence responses.
