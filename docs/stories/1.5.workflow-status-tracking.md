## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.4 completed the approval workflow implementation with confidence-based routing and manager approval actions. Story 1.5 builds on this by adding comprehensive workflow status tracking and visibility across the entire SMS processing lifecycle. This provides managers with real-time visibility into conversation progress and detailed audit trails for compliance.

### Workflow Status Tracking Component
**Key Interfaces:**
- `GET /orchestrate/workflow/{conversation_id}/status` - Workflow status endpoint
- `create_workflow_instance(conversation_id, tenant_id, phone_number) -> WorkflowInstance`
- `update_workflow_status(workflow_id, status, metadata) -> bool`
- `get_workflow_status(conversation_id) -> WorkflowStatusResponse`
- `create_workflow_step(workflow_id, step_name, step_type) -> WorkflowStep`
- `handle_workflow_recovery(workflow_id, error_context) -> bool`

**Dependencies:** Supabase (workflow persistence), existing orchestration and approval services

**Technology Stack:** FastAPI router, workflow state machine, async database operations, audit trail logging

### Database Schema for Workflow Tracking
**WorkflowInstance Table Structure:**
- id: UUID - Primary key and workflow identifier
- conversation_id: UUID - Links to SMS conversation in SMS Agent
- workflow_type: String - Type of workflow (sms_processing, payment_plan_validation, escalation)
- status: String - Current state (received, processing, awaiting_approval, sent, escalated, failed, completed)
- tenant_id: String - Tenant identifier from Collections Monitor
- phone_number: String - Tenant phone number
- started_at: Timestamp - Workflow initiation time
- completed_at: Timestamp - Workflow completion time (nullable)
- error_message: String - Error details if workflow failed
- metadata: JSON - Additional workflow-specific data

**WorkflowStep Table Structure:**
- id: UUID - Primary key for audit entry
- workflow_id: UUID - Reference to parent workflow
- step_name: String - Descriptive step name
- step_type: String - Step category (api_call, ai_processing, database_operation, notification)
- status: String - Step status (started, completed, failed, skipped)
- input_data: JSON - Step input parameters
- output_data: JSON - Step results
- error_details: JSON - Error information if failed
- started_at: Timestamp - Step start time
- completed_at: Timestamp - Step completion time
- duration_ms: Integer - Step execution duration

**Indexes:** conversation_id, status, tenant_id, last_message_at for performance

### Workflow State Machine
**Required Status States:**
- **received**: SMS message received and workflow created
- **processing**: AI response generation and external service calls in progress
- **awaiting_approval**: Response queued for manager approval
- **sent**: Approved response sent to tenant
- **escalated**: Workflow escalated due to low confidence or triggers
- **failed**: Workflow failed due to errors
- **completed**: Workflow successfully completed

**State Transitions:**
1. received → processing (when AI generation starts)
2. processing → awaiting_approval (for medium confidence responses)
3. processing → sent (for high confidence auto-sent responses)
4. processing → escalated (for low confidence or trigger-based escalations)
5. awaiting_approval → sent (when manager approves)
6. awaiting_approval → sent (when manager modifies response)
7. awaiting_approval → escalated (when manager escalates)
8. Any state → failed (on errors)
9. Any state → completed (on successful resolution)

### Workflow Status API Specification
**GET /orchestrate/workflow/{conversation_id}/status Endpoint:**
- Purpose: Retrieve current workflow status and detailed step history
- Path parameter: conversation_id (UUID) - Conversation identifier
- Response: 200 OK with complete workflow status information
- Error handling: 404 for non-existent workflows, 500 for server errors

### Project Structure
Based on the source tree architecture, this story requires creating:
- `app/services/workflow_service.py` - Workflow status tracking and state machine logic
- `app/api/workflow.py` - Workflow status API endpoint
- `app/models/workflow.py` - WorkflowInstance and WorkflowStep models
- `app/schemas/workflow.py` - WorkflowStatusResponse and related schemas
- `tests/test_api/test_workflow.py` - Workflow status endpoint tests
- `tests/test_services/test_workflow_service.py` - Workflow service logic tests

The project structure already has the foundation from Stories 1.1-1.4 with core services, API structure, and database models. This story integrates with existing orchestration and approval services to provide comprehensive workflow visibility.
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: FastAPI 0.104+ with async endpoint support
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for workflow instance and step tracking
- **State Machine**: Custom workflow state management with Python enums
- **Validation**: Pydantic models for request/response validation
- **Error Handling**: Custom exceptions with workflow recovery logic
- **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs for audit trail
- **Performance**: Optimized database queries with proper indexing

### Coding Standards
- Use snake_case for files and functions: `workflow_service.py`, `update_workflow_status()`
- Use PascalCase for classes: `WorkflowService`, `WorkflowInstance`
- Always validate external inputs using Pydantic models
- Use structured logging with correlation IDs (no console.log)
- Database operations through service layer, never direct from API routes
- All workflow status changes must create audit trail entries
- Use async/await patterns for all database operations
- Follow existing error handling patterns with proper status codes
- Implement proper timeout handling for external service calls
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Testing
**Test Requirements:**
- Framework: pytest 7.4+ with pytest-asyncio
- File location: `tests/test_api/` and `tests/test_services/` mirroring app structure
- Mock external dependencies: Supabase, OpenAI, external services
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Target: 80% line coverage for critical paths

**Test Scenarios to Include:**
- Workflow state machine transitions with all valid status changes
- Invalid state transitions and proper error handling
- Workflow status endpoint with various conversation states
- Database operations for workflow creation and status updates
- Audit trail creation for all workflow status changes
- Integration with existing SMS and approval workflows
- Error recovery scenarios and workflow restoration
- Performance testing with concurrent workflow operations
- API response format validation and error conditions
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

### Configuration Requirements
Environment variables needed (add to config.py if not present):
- `WORKFLOW_TIMEOUT_HOURS`: Maximum hours before workflow timeout (default: 48)
- `WORKFLOW_CLEANUP_DAYS`: Days to retain completed workflows (default: 30)
- `MAX_WORKFLOW_STEPS`: Maximum steps per workflow for safety (default: 50)

### Integration with Existing Services
This story integrates with:
- **Orchestration Service**: Create workflows on SMS receipt, update status during processing
- **Approval Service**: Update workflow status during approval processes
- **Database Service**: Store workflow instances and steps with proper indexing
- **Circuit Breaker**: Handle workflow failures gracefully with recovery logic

### Workflow Recovery Logic
**Error Recovery Scenarios:**
- External service failures: Mark workflow as failed, implement retry logic
- Database connectivity issues: Queue status updates, apply on reconnection
- Timeout scenarios: Auto-escalate workflows exceeding time limits
- Partial failures: Resume workflows from last successful step

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize database queries with conversation_id and status indexes
- Implement pagination for workflow step history
- Cache active workflow statuses in memory for performance
- Use async database operations to prevent blocking
- Implement connection pooling for database operations
