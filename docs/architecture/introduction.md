# Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for System Orchestrator Service, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

This is a backend-only service with no user interface components. All frontend requirements are handled by existing services (SMS Agent, Collections Monitor, Notification Service).

**Starter Template or Existing Project:**
N/A - Greenfield project developed from scratch as a standalone FastAPI service.
