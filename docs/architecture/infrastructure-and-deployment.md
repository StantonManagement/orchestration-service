# Infrastructure and Deployment

**Infrastructure as Code:**
- **Tool:** Docker Compose for local development
- **Location:** `./docker-compose.yml`
- **Approach:** Container-based deployment with environment-specific configurations

**Deployment Strategy:**
- **Strategy:** Blue/Green deployment with health checks
- **CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions (configurable)
- **Pipeline Configuration:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

**Environments:**
- **Development:** Local Docker Compose with all services running locally
- **Staging:** Cloud environment with test data for end-to-end validation
- **Production:** Cloud environment with real tenant data and monitoring

**Environment Promotion Flow:**
```
Development (Local) → Staging (Cloud) → Production (Cloud)
     ↓                       ↓                   ↓
  docker-compose      CI/CD Pipeline      CI/CD Pipeline
  up --build          Automated Tests     Manual Approval
```

**Rollback Strategy:**
- **Primary Method:** Instant rollback via blue/green deployment
- **Trigger Conditions:** Health check failures, error rate >5%, response time >5s
- **Recovery Time Objective:** <5 minutes
