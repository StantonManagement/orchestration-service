# Next Steps

After completing the System Orchestrator Service architecture:

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. **Review with Product Owner:** Present architecture document for approval and feedback
2. **Begin Story Implementation:** Use Dev agent to implement Epic 1 stories starting with service setup
3. **Set Up Infrastructure:** Configure Supabase database and external service integrations

**Development Priorities:**
1. **Epic 1 - Foundation & Core SMS Workflow:** Implement basic service structure and SMS processing
2. **Epic 2 - Payment Plan Processing & Escalation:** Add business logic for payment plans and escalations
3. **Epic 3 - Monitoring & Reliability:** Implement error handling, circuit breakers, and metrics

**Key Architectural Decisions Made:**
- **Simplified tech stack:** Removed Redis/Celery complexity, using database-based solutions
- **Microservices pattern:** Clear service boundaries with HTTP API coordination
- **Comprehensive audit trail:** Workflow step tracking for compliance and debugging
- **Resilient design:** Circuit breakers and retry logic for production reliability

**Ready for Development:**
The architecture provides complete guidance for AI agents and human developers to implement the System Orchestrator Service according to PRD requirements and Kurt's specifications. All critical decisions have been documented and the service is aligned with existing system architecture.
